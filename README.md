# Circuit-Solver

This project uses segmentation to recognize and classify different components from a hand drawn electronic circuit and generates a schematic for the LTSpice Simulation Tool.

Run schematic_generator.py and a window will appear where you can re check whether all the components are properly identified or not and in the latter case, you can even right click and select the correct component.
